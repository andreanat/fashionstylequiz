Overview
This project is an interactive command-line quiz application created to strengthen my skills as a software engineer working with JavaScript. The program presents a series of questions to help users identify their personal fashion style based on their preferences.

The purpose of this software was to practice JavaScript fundamentals including working with objects, arrays, loops, and handling user input through the readline module. Building this project helped me gain confidence in structuring a complete Node.js application from start to finish.

Development Environment

This software was developed using the following tools:
- Visual Studio Code for writing and editing the code
- Node.js to execute the JavaScript in a terminal environment
- Git for version control and publishing the project on GitHub

The project uses JavaScript and relies on Nodeâ€™s built-in readline module to create interactive user prompts.
