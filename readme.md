Overview
This project is an interactive command-line quiz application created to strengthen my skills as a software engineer working with JavaScript. The program presents a series of questions to help users identify their personal fashion style based on their preferences.

The purpose of this software was to practice JavaScript fundamentals including working with objects, arrays, loops, and handling user input through the readline module. Building this project helped me gain confidence in structuring a complete Node.js application from start to finish.
